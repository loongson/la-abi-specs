== Introduction

This document defines the constraints on the program contexts exchanged between
the caller and called subroutines or a subroutine and the execution environment.
The subroutines following these constraints can be compiled and assembled separately
and work together in the same program. The terms "subroutine", "function" and "procedure"
may be used interchangeably throughout this document.

That includes constraints on:

- The initial program context created by the caller for the callee.
- The program context when the callee finishes its execution and returns to the caller.
- How subroutine arguments and return values should be encoded in these program contexts.
- How certain global states may be accessed and preserved by all subroutines.

However, this document does not formally define how entities of standard programming
languages other than ISO C should be represented in the machine's program context, and
these language bindings should be described separately if needed.

== Processor Architecture

=== The registers

All LoongArch machines have 32 general-purpose registers and optionally 32
floating-point registers. Some of these registers may be used for passing
arguments and return values between the caller and callee subroutines.

The bit-width of both general-purpose registers and floating-point registers
may be either 32- or 64-bit, depending on whether the machine implements the LA32
or LA64 instruction set, and whether or not do they have a single- or double-precision FPU.

NOTE: In the following text, we use the term "temporary register" for
referring to caller-saved registers and "static registers" for callee-saved registers.

=== The memory and the byte order

The memory is byte-addressable for LoongArch machines, and the ordering of the bytes
in machine-supported multi-byte data types is *little-endian*. That is, the least
significant byte of a data object is at the lowest byte address the data object
occupies in memory.

The least significant byte of a 32-bit GPR / 64-bit GPR / 32-bit FPR / 64-bit GPR
is defined as storing the lowest byte of the data loaded from the memory with one
`ld.w` / `ld.d` / `fld.s` / `fld.d` instruction. This byte order is also respected
by other instructions that move typed data across registers such as `movgr2fr.d`.

In this document, when referring to a data object (of any type) stored in a register,
it is assumed that these objects begin with the least significant byte of the register
with no lower-byte paddings.

=== The base ABI variants

Depending on the bit-width of the general-purpose registers and the floating-point
registers, different ABI variants can be adopted to preserve arguments and return
values in the registers as long as it is possible.

variants may result in linker errors or run-time failures.

== Data Representation

This specification defines machine data types that represents ISO C's scalar,
aggregate (structure and array) and union data types, as well as their layout
within the program context when passed as arguments and return values of procedures.

|===

NOTE: In the following text, the term "integral object" or
"integral type" also covers the pointers.

[[int_ext_rules]]
When passed in registers as subroutine arguments or return values,
the unsigned integral objects are zero-extended, and the signed
integer data types are sign-extended if the containing register
is larger in size.

One exception to the above rule is that in the *LP64D* ABI, unsigned words,
such as those representing `unsigned int` in <<C-data-types, C>>,
are stored in general-purpose registers as proper _sign extensions_ of
their 32-bit values.

=== Structures, arrays and unions

The following conventional rules are respected:

* Structures, arrays and unions assume the alignment of their most strictly
aligned components (i.e. with the largest natural alignment).

* The size of any object is always a multiple of its alignment.
Tail paddings are applied to structures and unions if it is necessary
to comply with this rule. The state of the padding bytes are not defined.

* Each member within a structure or an array is consecutively
assigned to the lowest available offset with the appropriate alignment,
in the order of their definitions.

Structures and unions may be passed in registers as arguments or return values.
The layout rules of their members within the registers are described
in the following section.

=== Bit-fields

Structures and unions may include bit-fields, which are integral values of
a declared integral type with a specified bit-width. The specified bit-width
of a bit-field may not be greater than the width of its declared type.

A bit-field must be contained in a block of memory that is appropriate to
store its declared type, but it can share the same addressable byte with
adjacent bitfields in the structure.

When determining the alignment of the structure or the union, only the
member bitfields' declared integral types are considered, and their
specified widths are irrelevant.

It is possible to define unnamed bit-fields in C. The declared type of these
bit-fields do not affect the alignment of a structure or union.

=== Vectors

A vector can be either 128 bits or 256 bits wide and can always be interpreted
as an array of multiple elements of the same basic machine type, with each element
referred to using an index starting from 0. The lower-indexed elements are located
on the lower-ordered bits of the vector.

== Subroutine Calling Sequence

A subroutine as described in this specification may have none or arbitrary number
of *arguments* and one *return value*. Each argument or return value have
exactly one of the machine data types.

The standard calling requirements apply only to functions exported to link-editors
and dynamic loaders. Local functions that are not reachable from other compilation
units may use other calling conventions.

Empty structure / union arguments and return values should be simply ignored by C
compilers which support them as a non-standard extension.

=== The registers

The rationale of the LoongArch procedure calling convention is to pass
arguments and return values in registers as long as it is possible, so that
memory access and/or cache usage can be reduced to improve program performance.

The registers that can be used for passing arguments and returning values are
the *argument registers*, which include:

* *GARs*: 8 general-purpose registers `$a0` - `$a7`, where `$a0` and `$a1` are
also used for integral values.

* *FARs*: 8 floating-point registers `$fa0` - `$fa7`, where `$fa0` and `$fa1`
are also used for returning values.

An argument is passed using the stack only when no appropriate argument register
is available.

Subroutines should ensure that the initial values of the general-purpose registers
`$s0` - `$s9` and floating-point registers `$fs0` - `$fs7` are preserved across
the call.

At the entry of a procedure call, the return address of the call site is stored
in `$ra`. A branch jump to this address should be the last instruction executed
in the called procedure.

=== The stack

Each called subroutine in a program may have a stack frame on the run-time stack.
A stack frame is a contiguous block of memory with the following layout:

[caption=]
[%header,cols="^1,^2,^1"]
|===
|Position      |Content         |Frame

|incoming `$sp` +
(high address)
|_(optional padding)_ +
incoming stack arguments
|Previous

|
|... +
saved registers +
local variables +
paddings
.2+|Current

|outgoing `$sp` +
(low address)
|_(optional padding)_ +
outgoing stack arguments
|===

The stack frame is allocated by subtracting a positive value from the stack
pointer `$sp`. Upon procedure entry, the stack pointer is required to be
divisible by 16, ensuring a 16-byte alignment of the frame.

The first argument object passed on the stack (which may be the argument itself
or its on-stack portion) is located at offset 0 of the incoming stack pointer;
the following argument objects are stored at the lowest subsequent addresses that
meet their respective alignment requirements.

Procedures must not assume the persistence of on-stack data of which
the addresses lie below the stack pointer.


=== Passing arguments

When determining the layout of argument data, the arguments should be assigned to
their locations in the program context sequentially, in the order they appear in
the argument list.

The location of an argument passed by value may be either one of:

1. An argument register.
2. A pair of argument registers with adjacent numbers.
3. A GAR and an FAR.
4. A contiguous block of memory in the stack arguments region, with a constant
offset from the caller's outgoing `$sp`.
5. A combination of 1. and 4.

The on-stack part of the structure and scalar arguments are aligned to
the greater of the type alignment and GRLEN bits, except when this alignment
is larger than the 16-byte stack alignment. In this case, the part of the
argument should be 16-byte-aligned.

In a procedure call, GARs / FARs are generally only used for passing
non-floating-point / floating-point argument data, respectively.
However, the floating-point member of a structure or union argument,
or a vector/floating-point argument wider than FRLEN may be passed in a GAR,
specifically:

* A quadruple-precision floating-point argument may be passed or returned
in a pair of GARs if the GARs are 64-bit wide, otherwise it would be passed
or returned entirely on the stack.

* An 128-bit vector may be passed in a pair of GARs with adjacent numbers
or the combination of a single GAR and a block of memory on the stack if
the GARs are 64-bit wide, otherwise it will be passed or returned entirely
on the stack.

NOTE: Currently, the following detailed description of parameter passing rules
is only guaranteed to cover the `lp64d` and `lp64s` variant, that is, `GRLEN` is
`64` and `FRLEN` is `64` or `0`.

NOTE: In the following text, w~arg~ is used for denoting the size of the
argument object in bits. And unless otherwise specified, "passed on the stack"
implies "passed by value".

==== Scalars of fundamental types

There are two cases:

* 0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a single argument register, or on the stack
if none is available.

** An fp32 / fp64 argument is passed in an FAR if there is one available.
Otherwise, it is passed in a GAR, or on the stack if none of the GARs are
available. When passed in registers or on the stack, fp32 / fp64 arguments
narrower than GRLEN bits are widened to GRLEN bits, with the upper bits undefined.

** An integral argument is passed in a GAR if there is one available.
Otherwise, it is passed on the stack. If the argument is narrower than the
containing GAR, the <<int_ext_rules, general rules of integral extensions>>
applies.

* GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a pair of GARs with adjacent numbers, with the
lower-ordered GRLEN bits in the low-numbered register. If only one GAR
is available, the lower-ordered GRLEN bits are passed in this register
and the higher-ordered GRLEN bits are passed on the stack. If no GAR is
available, the whole argument is passed on the stack.

==== Structures

Upon function calls and returns, a structure argument's storage location
is mainly determined by its size and the number of floating-point
and/or integer members it contains. A structure argument can be passed
in up to two registers if available.

The storage layout of a structure containing other structures or arrays
is the same as its flattened counterpart, where the member structures are
replaced by its individual members and member arrays of length n (n > 0)
are broken down into n consecutive members of its element type.

NOTE: Empty structures or unions are zero-sized in C while they have
the size of 1 byte in {Cpp}.

For example, `struct { struct { double d[1]; } a[2]; }` and
`struct { double d0; double d1; }` should have the same storage layout when
passed as function parameters.

*Structures without floating-point members*

* w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN

** The argument is passed by reference, i.e. replaced in the argument list with
its memory address. If there is an available GAR, the address is passed in the
GAR, otherwise it is passed on the stack.

* GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a pair of GARs with adjacent numbers, with the
lower-ordered GRLEN bits in the low-numbered register. If only one GAR is
available, the lower-ordered GRLEN bits are passed in this register and the
higher-ordered GRLEN bits are passed on the stack. If no GAR is available, the
whole argument is passed on the stack.

* 0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a GAR if there is one available with the members
laid out as if they were stored in memory. Otherwise, it is passed on the
stack.

* w~arg~ = 0

** Zero-sized structure arguments are ignored.

*Structures with floating-point members*

* If the structure consists of one floating-pointer member within FRLEN bits
wide, it is passed in an FAR if available.

* If the structure consists of two floating-point members both within FRLEN
bits wide, it is passed in two FARs if available.

* If the structure consists of one integer member within GRLEN bits wide
and one floating-point member within FRLEN bits wide, it is passed in a GAR
and an FAR if available.

* Additionally, if there are only zero-sized members including structures,
arrays or bit-fields, or empty structure in {Cpp}, beside the structure
members described in the above three rules, these additional members are simply
ignored by the compiler, unless the considered additional member is a structure
and has a nontrivial destructor or a copy constructor defined in {Cpp}.

NOTE: In the above case, non-zero-length arrays of empty structures in {Cpp}
are not ignored by the compiler as additional members in the considered
structure.

* Otherwise, the structure is passed according to the same rule as structures
without floating-point members which is described above.

==== Unions

Unions are only passed in the GARs or on the stack, depending on its size.

* w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN

** The union is passed by reference and is replaced in the argument list with
its memory address. If there is an available GAR, the reference is passed in
the GAR, otherwise, the address is passed on the stack.

* GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a pair of available GARs, with the low-order bits
in the lower-numbered GAR and the high-order bits in the higher-numbered GAR.
If only one GAR is available, the low-order bits are in the GAR and the high-order
bits are on the stack. The arguments are passed on the stack when no GAR is available.

* 0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN

** The argument is passed in a GAR, or on the stack if no GAR is available.

* w~arg~ = 0

** Zero-sized union arguments are ignored.

==== Complex floating-points

A complex floating-point number, or a structure containing just one complex
fp32 / fp64 number, is passed as though it were a structure containing two
fp32 / fp64 members.

==== Vectors

* 128-bit vector argument

** An 128-bit vector argument are passed with two GARs with adjacent numbers
(if available), with the lower-ordered 64-bit passed in the lower-numbered
GAR and the higher-ordered 64-bit passed in the higher-numbered GAR.

** If only one GAR is available when allocating storage for this argument, the
lower-ordered 64-bit goes into the GAR and the higher-ordered 64-bit are passed
on the stack.

** If no GAR is available, the vector argument is passed entirely on the stack.

* 256-bit vector argument

** 256-bit vector arguments are passed on the stack, either by reference if there
is a GAR available for its address, or by value otherwise.

Vector members of structure arguments follow the same rules as above.

==== Variadic arguments

A variadic argument list can appear at the end of a procedure's argument list,
which contains argument objects whose number and types are not statically
declared with the procedure itself.

A variadic argument's location is also decided using its bit-width. If one
of the variadic arguments is passed on the stack, all subsequent arguments
should also be passed on the stack. The variadic arguments never occupy the
FARs.

* w~arg~ > 2 × GRLEN

** The arguments are passed by reference and are replaced in the argument list
with the address. If there is an available GAR, the reference is passed in
the GAR, and passed on the stack if no GAR is available.

* GRLEN < w~arg~ ≤ 2 × GRLEN

** An argument object in the variadic argument list with 2 × GRLEN alignment
and size (e.g. an fp128 object) is passed in a pair of adjacent available GARs
of which the first register is even-numbered. If only one GAR is available,
the argument is passed on the stack, and this GAR would not be used for passing
subsequent argument objects.

** For other types of argument objects, the variadic arguments are passed in a
pair of GARs. If only one GAR is available, the low-order bits are in the GAR
and the high-order bits are on the stack.

** If no GAR is available, the argument object is passed on the stack by value.

* 0 < w~arg~ ≤ GRLEN

** The variadic arguments are passed in a GAR, or on the stack by value if no
GAR is available.

=== Returning

In general, `$a0` and `$a1` are used for returning non-floating-point values,
while `$fa0` and `$fa1` are used for returning floating-point values.

Values are returned in the same manner the first named argument
of the same type would be passed. If such an argument would have
been passed by reference, the caller should allocate memory for the
return value, and passes the address as an implicit first argument
that is stored in `$a0`.
