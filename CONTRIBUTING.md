# Contributing to the Application Binary Interface

## Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

We accept bug fixes and feature proposals through two means: by filing an issue,
or by submitting a pull request (PR).

## Create an issue

You can create an issue at https://github.com/loongson/la-abi-specs/issues to
submit bug reports or make proposals.

## Pull request

To contribute fixes or improvements, you are welcome to submit a pull request
on https://github.com/loongson/la-abi-specs/pull. The workflow for submitting
a pull request is as follows:

### Sign Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors must sign CLA before their pull requests can be merged. Please
contact wuqingling@loongson.cn regarding how to sign the CLA.

### Make the actual pull request

Follow [Github pull requests documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
to submit the PR.

### Review of pull request

Pull requests need to be reviewed before they can be merged. Anyone can review
the requests, but approval from at least one Loongson reviewer is required.

### Merging the change

Pull request can be merged once the change has been reviewed properly, which
can only be done by one of the administrators. If your change hasn't been merged
for more than a week after it has been accepted, leave a comment on the pull
request.
